							%p In 2009, Adam made what accidentally became the first of his many videos for neat tech products. He&rsquo;d co-developed an iOS app with a friend, made a video to promote it, and became his own first client. A year later, he started Sandwich Video and began to grow the company into what it is nowâ€”a team of talented people he enjoys working with every day he can.
							%p He has a personal blog <a href="#" title="Follow Adam on Twitter" target="_blank">lonelysandwich</a>, but it&rsquo;s silly.
